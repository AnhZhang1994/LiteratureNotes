# [Predicting ammonia nitrogen in surface water by a new attention-based deep learning hybrid model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935122020503)

Journal: Environmental Research (Q1)

## Abstract
 A new hybrid model BC-MODWT-DA-LSTM was proposed based on LSTM combining with the dual-stage attention (DA) mechanism and boundary corrected maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (BC-MODWT) data decomposition method.

 ## Highlights
- Enhance the LSTM model by selectively paying attention to the input data and the computational efficiency could be maintained.
- Expalainability of the model is improved by designing the attention mechanism with setting weights on input information
