## Abstract


## Method  
sparse auto-encoder (SAE) and LSTM
0. missing values were imputed using linear interpolation
1. Anomaly detection using SAE
Divid data ijnto

# Data 

multivariate time series data included six kinds of observations, that is, water temperature, salinity, pH, temperature, air pressure, and rainfall, while univariate data considered only one kind of observation

Data for 120 days
