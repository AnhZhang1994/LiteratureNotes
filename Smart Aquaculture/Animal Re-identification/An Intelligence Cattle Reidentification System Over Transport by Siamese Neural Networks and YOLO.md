# [An Intelligence Cattle Reidentification System Over Transport by Siamese Neural Networks and YOLO](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10188912/authors#authors)

Journal: IOTJ

## Absract

SNN + YOLO V5 for cattle reidentification.

## Data
800 cows' 30 videos (1 - 5 min) from a farm, cropped into 2500 cattle face images from 50 cattle.

400 images from youtube online video.


## Method
1. Detect cattle face using YOLO V5. (color normalization to reduce light difference)
