This work propose an explanable framework that labels items in the timeline of receiving recommendations and indroduces a set of metrics to capture the extent of personalization across user timelines.

*RQ1:* Given a sequence of content recommendations from a userâ€™s feed, how can we detect which recommendations are the result of personalization?

*RQ2:* How do video engagement factors influence the extent of user personalization on TikTok?
