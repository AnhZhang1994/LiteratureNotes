## Abstract

A hybrid deep learning model with automatic optimizer for free nitrous acid prediction. Nitrogen removal rate is highly correlated with free nitrous acid concentration.

## Points
Free nitrous acid (FNA) is a critical metric for stabilization of ANAMMOX but can not be directly and immediately measured by sensors or chemical measurement method

## Input data
pH, ORP (Oxidation reduction potential), NH4^+-N, and NO3^− –N
