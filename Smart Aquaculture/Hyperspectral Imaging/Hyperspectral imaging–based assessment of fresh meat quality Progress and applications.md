## Abstract
Given that traditional methods of meat quality analysis are time-consuming, destructive, and poorly suited for the rapid quality evaluation of production lines, the development of non-destructive technologies such as hyperspectral imaging has drawn much attention. Hyperspectral imaging technology, which combines imaging and spectroscopic techniques, provides spatial and spectral information to evaluate meat quality. Hyperspectral imaging has been used to assess the composition, physicochemical and sensory properties, and microbial spoilage of meat and achieve quality or specific property–based classification. The present review describes the basic principles and system configuration of hyperspectral imaging and its applications in meat quality analysis.
