# Personal paper reading review
I have a broad interest in security&privacy and computational social science (especially in social media). During my master's, I had read a lot of paper, but unfortunately I didn't record them systematically, resulting in a lot of them being lost. Now, I'm starting to try to document them online for easy storage. This repo is also being published as a gitbook: https://lus-organization.gitbook.io/lu_paper_reading/
