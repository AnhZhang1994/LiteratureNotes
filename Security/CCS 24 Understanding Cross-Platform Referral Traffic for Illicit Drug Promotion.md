2. Basic text processing for the comments. Consolidate successive comments posted in 5 min.

3. BERT classifier (positive/negative:9000/9000). (note: Cohenâ€™s Kappa coefficient of 0.90). Performance: 99.92% F1.

### Tracking
Apart from self-built website, they primarily use insta (with the abbreviation ig)

Pipeline: detector to get the text -> regex to get vendors' user name and located platform
