## Abstract
LLM can get involved in time series analysis.

## LLM Background
    - Pro: 0 shot 
    - Con: Primary for Text sequence
Idea: time series and textual information provide essential contexts, LLMs contribute internal knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and pre-trained time series models offer fundamental pattern recognition assurances

Time series data modality:
- Univariate: X = {x1, x2, · · · , xT } ∈ R^T
- Multivariate: X = {x1, x2, · · · , xT } ∈ R^(N*T)
